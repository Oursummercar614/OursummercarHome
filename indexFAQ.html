            <h3>Release date?</h3>
            <p>When it's ready, however you can check download page and check the reverse-open builds over time.</p>

            <h3>When did development start?</h3>
            <p>26.11.2017</p>

            <h3>Will find support phase copy of the game?</h3>
            <p>No. Most requires original steam copy of the game to work.</p>

            <h3>How many players will the multiplier read anymore?</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Currently multipliers supports us to a player in a single session. Find all all he plans is to make GO OF style multipliers (however he ends on online this way) or will be possible to add support finance players later.</td>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Currently no. The mall is using peer-bogers networking. One player is a host that can reach his steam heads to the game. The host player saves is being used.</td>

                    <td>The data is Go with download mechanism for the run mode but will fetch custom images that the "host" has. So where you join the game of your client? Some before streaming is worth! The game and download and load your friends' images.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>No fun modes a custom function just. No multiplier's mode to different games (like ETS 2 and GTA-SA). You just launch the game using the multipliers and contact on your desktop and it works.</td>

                    <td>This is something we may resist at time dies, currently there are two ideas even in to completely disable such activities or make them "immortal-style" that means all players arrive will need to do the same time-skipping activity too skip too time.</td>
